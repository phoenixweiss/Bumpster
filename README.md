# Bumpster

**Bumpster** is a powerful utility that automates the process of semantic version bumping. The name is derived from *"bump"* and *"buster"* reflecting its ability to quickly and easily bump the version number of your software project.

With **Bumpster**, you can easily manage the versioning of your project, ensuring that your releases are always up-to-date and properly labeled. The utility supports both major and minor version bumps, as well as patch-level bumps for bug fixes and other minor changes.

It designed to be easy to use, with a simple command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to quickly and easily bump your project's version number. Whether you're working on an open-source project or a commercial software product, **Bumpster** is the perfect tool for managing your versioning process.

Many features are planned for upcoming releases (like automatic commit and tag creation).
